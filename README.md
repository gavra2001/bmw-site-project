# BMW Custom Website Project
## Overview
Welcome to the repository for my custom-made website for BMW, created as a project for my web design class back in 2021. This project was an integral part of my learning journey in web development and design, where I explored various aspects of creating a functional and visually appealing website.

## Project Description
This project is a fully custom website designed for BMW. The site was built to showcase my ability to implement web design principles and my growing understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Despite being created a few years ago, the website remains a testament to my progress and dedication to learning web development.

## Key Features
* Custom Layout: The website features a unique layout tailored to the BMW brand, focusing on aesthetics and user experience.
* Responsive Design: While the responsiveness might not be perfect, the site attempts to adapt to different screen sizes.
* Interactive Elements: Basic interactive elements implemented using JavaScript to enhance user engagement.

## Learning Experience
Creating this website was a significant learning experience. During the development process, I:
* Learned on the Go: The code might appear messy, and I admittedly overused inline styles with the style attribute instead of external CSS files. This was part of my learning curve as I was figuring out how to implement various features.
* Minimal CSS Usage: Due to my initial unfamiliarity with CSS, much of the styling was done directly in the HTML. This is something I would handle differently with more experience now.
* Visual Outcome: Despite the coding shortcuts and learning hurdles, I am proud of the final visual outcome of the website. It effectively represents the BMW brand and showcases the skills I acquired at the time.

## Project Setup
To view the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/gavra2001/site-project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd site-project`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the site.

## Future Improvements
If I were to revisit this project, I would focus on:
* Refactoring the code to use external CSS for styling.
* Improving the responsiveness of the site for various devices.
* Enhancing the interactive elements with more advanced JavaScript and modern frameworks.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a milestone in my web development journey. I appreciate any feedback and suggestions for improvement. Thank you for checking out my BMW website project!
